## Filecash Improvement Protocol

The Filecash Improvement Protocol contains the set of fundamental governing principles for the Filecash Network. It outlines the vision for Filecash and the principles, processes, and parties involved in making decisions that affect the future of the network. It also describes how improvements to these rules can be proposed and ratified.


## The Filecash Vision

Filecash is a peer-to-peer network that stores files, with built-in economic incentives to ensure that files are stored reliably over time. Its mission is to create a decentralized, efficient and robust foundation for humanity’s information. To advance that mission, Filecash has created a decentralized storage network that lets anyone in the world store or retrieve files. 

In Filecash, users pay to store their files on storage miners. Storage miners are computers responsible for storing files and proving they have stored the files correctly over time. Anyone who wants to store their files or get paid for storing other users’ files can join Filecash. Available storage and pricing are not controlled by any single entity. Instead, Filecash facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in, thereby providing storage to billions of people who are currently locked out of the web.

## Filecash Design Principles

The design of Filecash is intended to follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.


## Filecash Improvement Principles

When making decisions about how to improve Filecash, we will follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.


## Making changes to the Filecash network

[Filecash Improvement Proposals (FIPs)](https://github.com/filecash/CIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0001.md) are the primary mechanism by which the Filecash community can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the Filecash network. These discussions and decisions should be guided by the governance and design principles above.

FIPs are classified into three categories:

**Technical FIPs, or Filecash Technical Proposals (FTPs)** are designed to gather community feedback on technical Filecash issues. These include changes to the Filecash protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, and proposed application standards or conventions. They are then reviewed by the Filecash community and the technical steering committee. They are normally followed by a PR to the [Filecash Specification repository](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs) to update the protocol's spec.

**Organizational FIPs, or Filecash Organization Proposals (FOPs)** allow the Filecash community to propose, discuss, and achieve consensus on Filecash governance. This includes procedures, guidelines, decision-making processes, and changes to FIP processes.

**Recovery FIPs, or Filecash Recovery Proposals (FRPs)** are intended to provide the Filecash community with a forum to raise, discuss, and achieve consensus on fault recovery and chain rewrites, under a very limited, clearly-defined set of criteria (ex, in the case of protocol bugs destroying network value). The community will help define this process as needed in the coming months.



## A decentralized, global network

Filecash is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to play a central role in the storage and distribution of humanity’s information. To help the network grow and evolve, it is critical for the community to collectively be engaged in proposing, discussing, and implementing changes that improve the network and its operations. 

This improvement protocol helps achieve that objective for all members of the Filecash community (developers, miners, clients, token holders, ecosystem partners, and more).
